    <h1>Fufu</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cassava flour or yam flour</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water: In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the flour: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium and gradually add the cassava or yam flour while stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Cook the fufu: Continue to stir the mixture vigorously as it thickens. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the fufu is smooth, thick, and stretchy. If it becomes too thick, you can add a little more water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Shape and serve: Once cooked, scoop the fufu onto a plate and shape it into a mound using the back of a spoon. Serve hot with your favorite soup or stew, such as egusi, ogbono, or vegetable soup.</li>
    </ol>
