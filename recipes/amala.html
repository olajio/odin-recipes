    <h1>Amala</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups yam flour (elubo)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water: In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. You can add a pinch of salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Add the yam flour: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium and gradually add the yam flour while stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li>Cook the amala: Continue to stir the mixture vigorously as it thickens. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the amala is smooth, thick, and stretchy. If it becomes too thick, you can add a little more water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Shape and serve: Once cooked, scoop the amala onto a plate and shape it into a mound using the back of a spoon. Serve hot with your favorite soup or stew, such as ewedu, gbegiri, or egusi soup.</li>
    </ol>
